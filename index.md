# Abstract or executive summary

Congestion is increasing in cities around the country, and particularly in the
Seattle region.  Local governments are increasingly experimenting with congestion
pricing schemes to manage congestion.  The Washington State Department of Transportation
(WSDOT) opened a congestion pricing facility in 2015 on I-405, which runs through
the eastern suburbs of Seattle.  The facility operates by selling extra space
in the high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to single-occupancy vehicles (SOVs),
and dynamically changing the price of entry to manage demand and keep the lanes
operating. These combined HOV and tolled SOV lanes are called High Occupancy
Tolling (HOT) lanes.

While the HOT lanes have been operative for over three years, there has been little
research into the equity impacts of the lanes.  Using data on each trip made on
the I-405 HOT lanes in 2018, demographic data on census block groups, and lane
speed, volume, and travel time data, we tried to answer this question. We
studied how the express toll lanes are used, the benefits they provide to the
region, and how these benefits are distributed among different groups of users.
